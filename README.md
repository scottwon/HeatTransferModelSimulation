# Heat Transfer Model Simulation for Multiple Layers of Medium
This is the paper for the National Contest of Mathematical Modelling. This is a teamwork and my teammates are Zhiheng Zhang and Wenyao Li.

This work won the second prize of National Contest of Mathematical Modelling.

My major contributions are:

1. To use forward difference method to solve the heat transfer equations numerically. First, I learned from textbooks how to use forward difference method to solve the heat transfer equations in the single-layer-medium case. Then, I managed to extend the forward difference method to the multiple-layer-medium case. I did both the modelling and the coding work within 3 days. 

2. To use Crank-Nicolson's method to solve the heat transfer equations numerically. First, I learned from textbooks how to use Crank-Nicolson's method to solve the heat transfer equations in the single-layer-medium case. Then, I put forward an approach to extend the Crank-Nicolson's method to the multiple-layer-medium case. I proved the correctness of my approach mathematically and I developed a program to solve the equations by the extended Crank-Nicolson's method.

Here is the result of my simulations:(temporarily unavailable)
